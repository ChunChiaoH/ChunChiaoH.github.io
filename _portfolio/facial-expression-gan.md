# Facial Expression Recognition with GAN-based Data Augmentation

## Project Overview

Led a team project focused on improving facial expression recognition accuracy through generative adversarial network (GAN) based data augmentation. This research demonstrated how synthetic data generation can address class imbalance and improve model generalization in computer vision tasks.

## Leadership & Team Coordination

### Team Management
- **Team Size**: 4 members (ML engineers and computer vision specialists)
- **Role**: Project Team Lead coordinating tasks among team members
- **Responsibilities**: Project planning, task delegation, technical mentoring, and timeline management
- **Collaboration**: Cross-functional coordination between data preparation, model development, and evaluation teams

### Project Planning
- Defined project scope and technical requirements
- Established development milestones and deliverables
- Coordinated resource allocation and computational requirements
- Implemented agile development practices for rapid iteration

## Technical Implementation

### Data Augmentation Strategy
- **Traditional Augmentation**: Rotation, scaling, color jittering, horizontal flipping
- **GAN-based Augmentation**: Synthetic facial expression generation using trained GANs
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combined traditional and generative techniques for maximum diversity
- **Quality Control**: Filtering mechanisms to ensure high-quality synthetic samples

### Model Architecture
```python
# Generative Model Pipeline
Generator: StyleGAN-based architecture for facial synthesis
Discriminator: Multi-scale discriminative network
Expression Classifier: ResNet-based backbone with attention mechanisms
Data Pipeline: Balanced sampling with quality-controlled augmentation
```

### Training Pipeline
- **Stage 1**: Train GAN on facial expression datasets
- **Stage 2**: Generate synthetic samples for underrepresented classes
- **Stage 3**: Train expression classifier on augmented dataset
- **Stage 4**: Evaluation and iterative improvement

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Class Imbalance
**Problem**: Facial expression datasets often have severe class imbalance  
**Solution**: GAN-based targeted generation for underrepresented expressions  
**Result**: Balanced training data leading to improved minority class performance

### Challenge 2: Synthetic Data Quality
**Problem**: Generated samples must be realistic and expression-consistent  
**Solution**: Multi-stage quality filtering and perceptual loss functions  
**Result**: High-quality synthetic data indistinguishable from real samples

### Challenge 3: Team Coordination
**Problem**: Coordinating multiple team members with different specializations  
**Solution**: Clear task delegation, regular standups, and shared development practices  
**Result**: Efficient collaboration and on-time project delivery
