# StyleGAN Implementation on OASIS Dataset

## Overview

This project involved implementing StyleGAN from scratch using PyTorch, specifically designed to generate realistic brain MRI images using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. The work was conducted as part of my Master's program at The University of Queensland.

## Project Objectives

- **Research Implementation**: Build StyleGAN architecture from academic papers
- **Medical Imaging Application**: Apply GAN technology to brain MRI generation
- **Latent Space Analysis**: Explore and visualize the learned feature representations
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieve high-quality image synthesis results

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Design
- **Generator Network**: Progressive growing architecture with style-based generation
- **Discriminator Network**: Multi-scale discriminative network for realistic output
- **Style Transfer**: Learned style codes for controllable generation
- **Adaptive Instance Normalization**: For style modulation at different resolutions

### Key Features
- Custom PyTorch implementation following StyleGAN paper specifications
- OASIS brain MRI dataset preprocessing and augmentation pipeline
- Progressive training strategy for stable learning
- Latent space exploration using UMAP dimensionality reduction
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (FID, IS, LPIPS)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Training Stability
**Problem**: GAN training notorious for instability and mode collapse  
**Solution**: Implemented progressive growing, spectral normalization, and careful learning rate scheduling

### Challenge 2: Medical Image Quality
**Problem**: Medical images require high fidelity and anatomical correctness  
**Solution**: Custom loss functions including perceptual loss and anatomical consistency checks

### Challenge 3: Computational Resources
**Problem**: Limited GPU resources for large-scale training  
**Solution**: Efficient batch processing, mixed precision training, and Docker containerization

## Results & Achievements

- ✅ **Successful Generation**: High-quality 256x256 brain MRI synthesis
- ✅ **Latent Space Discovery**: Meaningful semantic directions in feature space
- ✅ **Research Quality**: Implementation suitable for academic research
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Clean, documented, and reproducible codebase
