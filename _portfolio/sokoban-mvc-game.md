# Sokoban Game with MVC Architecture

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete implementation of the classic Sokoban puzzle game using clean Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture principles. The game showcases advanced software engineering practices, object-oriented design patterns, and interactive game development techniques.

## Game Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Classic Sokoban Mechanics**: Push boxes to designated storage locations
- **Multiple Levels**: Progressive difficulty with increasingly complex puzzles
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive keyboard input with visual feedback
- **Win Condition Detection**: Automatic level completion recognition
- **Move Counter**: Track efficiency and performance metrics

### Advanced Features
- **Undo/Redo System**: Complete move history with state management
- **Save/Load Functionality**: Persistent game state across sessions
- **Level Editor**: Built-in tools for creating custom levels
- **Theme Customization**: Multiple visual themes and tile sets
- **High Score Tracking**: Performance statistics and leaderboards

## MVC Architecture Implementation

### Model Layer
```java
public class GameModel {
    private GameState currentState;
    private LevelManager levelManager;
    private MoveHistory moveHistory;
    
    // Core game logic
    public boolean attemptMove(Direction direction) {
        // Validate move, update state, notify observers
    }
    
    // State management
    public void saveGameState() { ... }
    public void loadGameState() { ... }
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Game state management and validation
- Level data structure and manipulation
- Move history and undo/redo logic
- Save/load persistence functionality
- Business logic for win conditions

### View Layer
```java
public class GameView extends JPanel implements Observer {
    private GameRenderer renderer;
    private InputHandler inputHandler;
    
    @Override
    public void update(Observable o, Object arg) {
        // React to model changes
        repaint();
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        renderer.renderGame(g, gameModel.getCurrentState());
    }
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Visual rendering of game elements
- User interface components and layouts
- Animation and visual effects
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Accessibility features and themes

### Controller Layer
```java
public class GameController implements KeyListener {
    private GameModel model;
    private GameView view;
    
    @Override
    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        Direction dir = translateKeyToDirection(e);
        if (model.attemptMove(dir)) {
            view.updateDisplay();
        }
    }
    
    public void handleMenuAction(MenuAction action) { ... }
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Input handling and command translation
- Coordination between Model and View
- Menu navigation and game flow control
- Event dispatching and response management

## Technical Implementation

### Design Patterns Used

#### Observer Pattern
- **Implementation**: Model notifies View of state changes
- **Benefits**: Loose coupling, automatic UI updates
- **Usage**: Real-time game state synchronization

#### Command Pattern
- **Implementation**: Move history and undo/redo system
- **Benefits**: Easy undo functionality, move replay
- **Usage**: Complete game action management

#### Strategy Pattern
- **Implementation**: Different level loading strategies
- **Benefits**: Flexible level formats, easy extensibility
- **Usage**: Support for multiple level file formats

#### Factory Pattern
- **Implementation**: Game element creation
- **Benefits**: Centralized object creation, easy customization
- **Usage**: Dynamic level element instantiation

### Data Structures & Algorithms

#### Game State Representation
```java
public class GameState {
    private int[][] grid;           // 2D array for level layout
    private Position playerPos;     // Player coordinates
    private Set<Position> boxPositions;    // Dynamic box tracking
    private Set<Position> goalPositions;   // Static goal locations
    
    public GameState deepCopy() {
        // Efficient state cloning for undo system
    }
}
```

#### Pathfinding & Validation
- **Collision Detection**: Efficient boundary and obstacle checking
- **Move Validation**: Pre-move validation to prevent invalid states
- **Deadlock Detection**: Advanced algorithm to identify unsolvable positions
- **Optimal Solution Tracking**: Minimum move count calculation

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: State Management Complexity
**Problem**: Managing complex game state with undo/redo functionality  
**Solution**: Immutable state objects with efficient deep copying  
**Result**: Robust state management without memory leaks

### Challenge 2: Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Smooth rendering with complex level layouts  
**Solution**: Sprite caching, dirty region updates, and optimized rendering  
**Result**: 60fps gameplay on modest hardware

### Challenge 3: Extensible Level Design
**Problem**: Support for multiple level formats and custom levels  
**Solution**: Abstract level loader with format-specific implementations  
**Result**: Easy addition of new level formats and community content

### Challenge 4: User Experience Polish
**Problem**: Creating engaging and intuitive game interactions  
**Solution**: Smooth animations, audio feedback, and responsive controls  
**Result**: Professional-quality game feel and user satisfaction

## Code Quality & Best Practices

### Object-Oriented Design
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with controlled access methods
- **Inheritance**: Logical class hierarchies for game elements
- **Polymorphism**: Interface-based design for extensibility
- **Abstraction**: Clean separation of concerns across layers

### Code Documentation
```java
/**
 * Attempts to move the player in the specified direction.
 * Validates the move, updates game state if valid, and
 * notifies observers of state changes.
 *
 * @param direction The direction to attempt movement
 * @return true if the move was successful, false otherwise
 * @throws IllegalStateException if game is in invalid state
 */
public boolean attemptMove(Direction direction) { ... }
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: MVC layer interaction testing
- **Game Logic Tests**: Move validation and win condition testing
- **UI Tests**: User interaction and display testing
